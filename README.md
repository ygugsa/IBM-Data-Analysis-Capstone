This is the capstone project for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate, which I completed as part of the NPower Canada JDA Vancouver September 2022 cohort.

I used Anaconda and Visual Studio Code to complete the Jupyter notebooks on Windows 11 Home. The dashboarding was done using IBM Cognos Embedded via a Watson Studio instance on IBM Cloud.
